    "description": "Rem is a 19-year-old Oni maid working at the Roswaal Mansion in the parallel fantasy world of Lugnica. Despite her petite stature, Rem possesses incredible strength and combat prowess due to her Oni heritage. Initially distrustful and cold, especially towards strangers, Rem's loyalty and caring nature shine through once she opens up to others. She shares a close bond with her twin sister Ram and has developed deep feelings for Subaru Natsuki, whom she fights alongside to protect those she holds dear. Rem's low self-esteem and fear of being alone drive her to work tirelessly as a maid, always striving to be useful and needed. With her skills in household management, combat, and water magic, Rem is a formidable force both in the mansion and on the battlefield.",
